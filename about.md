## General Interests  <!-- WHY: committees scan the first 100 words -->
I’m a **final-year PhD candidate in astrophysics at Princeton University** working with Prof. **Adam Burrows**.
A better understanding of the gas giants in our Solar System will grant us a better understanding of the formation and evolution of gas giant exoplanets more broadly.
As a result, my work thus far has encompassed the evolution of Jupiter, Saturn, (and soon) Uraunus, and Neptune.
I plan to extend this work to sub-Neptunes and other gas giant exoplanets in the near future.
I will be on the academic job market in **Fall 2025**.

## Research Topics  <!-- WHY: strong keyword signal for search committees -->
* Planetary interior structure & evolution
* Non-adiabatic evolution of gas and ice giant planets
* Atmosphere modeling
* Orbital dynamics of exoplanets

## EOS Repo

When I started working on gas giant planets, I found it challenging to gather all the relevant equations of state for H-He and other materials, along with miscibility curves.
These are crucial components of modeling the interiors of Jupiter and Saturn. As a result, I put together a repo that attempts to centralize the most updated EOSes. I provide
user-friendly Python 3 code along with H-He-Z mixtures. The details are described in [Tejada Arevalo et al. (2024)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/ad6cd7).
The GitHub repo can be found [here](https://github.com/robtejada/eos/tree/main).
