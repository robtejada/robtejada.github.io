## Background

I am a planetary modeler broadly interested in planetary evolution, formation, and internal dynamics. Born in El Salvador, I immigrated to the United States with my mother and sister at age 10. My academic journey has been non-traditional: I began my higher education at a community college three years after graduating from high school. Prior to pursuing academia, I worked in the fast-food industry and later in non-profit organizations. Though I aspired to become an astrophysicist since high school, achieving this goal initially seemed unattainable due to my circumstances. Now, as a Ph.D. candidate, I am committed not only to advancing my research but also to mentoring and supporting others from diverse backgrounds on their academic journeys.

## Hobbies

Like many astronomers, I am passionate about the outdoors. The photo featured on this homepage was taken at the Matanuska Glacier in Alaska, and the other was taken at the top of Yosemite Upper Falls Trail. Living in California has provided me with opportunities to explore numerous beautiful national parks, including Yosemite, which I visit annually. Beyond my love for nature, I am an enthusiastic amateur weightlifter. I constantly strive to grow both physically and mentally, believing strongly in the link between physical fitness and mental well-being. Maintaining physical health has significantly enhanced my scientific productivity and academic performance.
