## Personal Background

I am a planetary modeler broadly interested in planetary evolution, formation, and internal dynamics. My academic journey has been non-traditional: I began my higher education at a community college three years after graduating from high school. Prior to pursuing academia, I worked in the fast-food industry and later in non-profit organizations. Now, as a Ph.D. candidate, I am committed not only to advancing my research but also to mentoring and supporting others from disadvantaged backgrounds on their academic journeys.

## General Research Interests  <!-- WHY: committees scan the first 100 words -->
I’m a **final-year PhD candidate** in astrophysics at Princeton University working with Prof. Adam Burrows.
A better understanding of the gas giants in our Solar System will grant us a better understanding of the formation and evolution of gas giant exoplanets more broadly.
As a result, my thesis work thus far has encompassed the evolution of Jupiter, Saturn, (and soon) Uranus and Neptune.
I plan to extend this work to sub-Neptunes and other gas giant exoplanets in the near future.
I will be on the academic job market in **Fall 2025**.

## Research Topics
### Interior evolution of Uranus and Neptune
[Tejada Arevalo et al. (2025b)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/adf3a5) models the evolution of Uranus and Neptune informed by formation models using methane-ammonia-water equation of state mixtures under the influence of convective mixing. Here I found that while Uranus and Neptune could have formed with a similar composition gradient, their initial entropy/thermal profiles determine whether their envelopes homogonize, and thus whether they release their internal heat.

I propose here that the difference between the luminosities of Uranus and Neptune could be due to convective mixing of their interior structures: Uranus can retain its profile gradients, and Neptune could have mixed almost entirely, leading to Neptune's adiabatic cooling. This proposes a simple and unified explanation to the long standing puzzle of why their luminosities are so different despite both planets appearing similar in many other aspects. In the first plot blow, color lines represent different ages. Neptune (right) undergoes a rapid mixing event between 0.5 and 0.6 Gyr which releases its interior energy.

This mixing is observed in the second plot below as a quick but drastic increase in temperature, luminosity, and radius. After Neptune homogenizes, its outer envelope evolves adiabatically, explaining its present luminosity and radius.

### Interior evolution of Jupiter and Saturn
[Tejada Arevalo et al. (2025a)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada030) and [Sur et al. (2025)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/adad62) investigated the non-adiabatic and inhomogeneous evolution of Jupiter and Saturn in the presence of helium rain and extended or "fuzzy" cores. [Tejada Arevalo et al. (2025)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada030) found that if Jupiter has a fuzzy core, such extended region would convectively mix in evolutionary timescales. If Jupiter's fuzzy core as measured by *Juno* is a relic from formation, then Jupiter could have started with a colder interior rather than traditional hot start models. The figure below [Tejada Arevalo et al. (2025)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada030) is an example of our preferred evolution model matching the radius, effective temperature, atmospheric helium abundance, and outer metallicity of Jupiter which retains an extended core. The color lines are various ages of the model. Evolution models have been used to constrain the demixing temperature of hydrogen and helium in the past. These models predict higher demixing temperatures, closer to experimental results (see paper for more).

### Stability Characterization of V1298 Tau
[Tejada Arevalo et al. (2022)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ac70e0) focused on the orbital stability of the gas giants in the compact exoplanet system V1298 Tau. We found that the mass and eccentricity of third planet of the young V1298 Tau multi-planet system (V1298 Tau b) could be too large as indicated by early RV measurements. This was inferred by assessing the long-term stability of the system, finding that a lower mass of V1298 Tau b is likely for the system to survive to its current ~20 Myr age. In the figure below, red configurations are unstable.

### Tidal Spin-Up of Hot Jupiter Host Stars
[Tejada Arevalo et al. (2021)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac1429) compared the measured rotation periods and velocities of hot Jupiter host stars with those of cold Jupiter and small planet host stars. We found that hot Jupiter host stars spin faster than cold Jupiter or other host stars, casting additional nuance into the inferred ages of stars with stellar models. In the figure below, blue squares are spectroscopically measured rotation rates of hot Jupiter hosts and the orage are the same for the control samples.

## EOS Repo

When I started working on gas giant planets, I found it challenging to gather all the relevant equations of state for H-He and other materials, along with miscibility curves.
These are crucial components of modeling the interiors of Jupiter and Saturn. As a result, I put together a repo that attempts to centralize the most updated EOSes. I provide
user-friendly Python 3 code along with H-He-Z mixtures. The details are described in [Tejada Arevalo et al. (2024)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/ad6cd7).
The GitHub repo can be found [here](https://github.com/robtejada/eos/tree/main). A downloadable version of the EOS repo can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1V13BQLZ9_VKWoZQp6T5i7OXp8zreIrt7)

## Hobbies

Like many astronomers, I am passionate about the outdoors. The photo featured on this homepage was taken at the Matanuska Glacier in Alaska, and the other was taken at the top of Yosemite Upper Falls Trail. Living in California has provided me with opportunities to explore numerous beautiful national parks, including Yosemite, which I visit annually.

Beyond my love for nature, I am an enthusiastic amateur weightlifter. I constantly strive to grow both physically and mentally, believing strongly in the link between physical fitness and mental well-being. Maintaining physical health has significantly enhanced my scientific productivity and academic performance.
